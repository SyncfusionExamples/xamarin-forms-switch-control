# Xamarin Forms Switch control
This repository contains the demo for the usage of Syncfusion Xamarin.Forms Switch control. This Switch control provides support to 3 different states, on, off and intermediate.

## Getting Started with Xamarin Switch (SfSwitch)
This section explains you the steps to add the SfSwitch control with basic functionalities in Xamarin.Forms.

## Assembly deployment
After installing Essential Studio for Xamarin, you can find all the required assemblies in the installation folders, {Syncfusion Essential Studio Installed location} \Essential Studio\{Version #}\Xamarin\lib.

## Adding SfSwitch reference
You can add SfSwitch reference using one of the below methods.

### Method 1: Adding SfSwitch reference from nuget.org

Syncfusion Xamarin components are available in nuget.org. To add SfSwitch to your project, open the NuGet package manager in Visual Studio, search for Syncfusion.Xamarin.Core, and then install it.

### Method 2: Adding SfSwitch reference from toolbox

Syncfusion provides Xamarin Toolbox. Using this toolbox, you can drag the SfSwitch control to the XAML page. It will automatically install the required NuGet packages and add the namespace to the page. To install Syncfusion Xamarin Toolbox, refer to Toolbox.

### Method 3: Adding SfSwitch assemblies manually from the installed location

If you prefer to manually reference the assemblies instead referencing from NuGet, add the following assemblies in respective projects.

Location: {Installed location}/{version}/Xamarin/lib

## Initializing SfSwitch
Import the Button namespace as shown below in your respective Page,

**[XAML]**
```
xmlns:syncfusion="clr-namespace:Syncfusion.XForms.Buttons;assembly=Syncfusion.Buttons.XForms"
```
Then initialize the switch control as shown below using the code example.
**[XAML]**
```
<syncfusion:SfSwitch />
```
